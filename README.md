# V0 Goals

- responsive nav bar
- make sure all the links go to the right places
- make the bottom row a menu + linkout row
- make the bottom row an outline button, the other rows ghost buttons
- make the [handle] page init/load/final state flow
- add the PFP to the Relay card
- create an NFT card (maybe)
- maybe come up with a way to fill the neg space in the placeholders
